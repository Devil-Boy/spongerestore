# SpongeRestore Configuration
#

# Excluded worlds [names separated by commas]
#	Here you list all the worlds in which you
#	do not want this plugin to work in.
excludedWorlds=none

# Sponge saturation [true or false]
#	Add more realism to sponges by making them only
#	absorb water from an area without blocking
#	water's flow afterwards.
spongeSaturation=false

# Water replacement
#	Can a player place water near a sponge
#	while it is still there?
canPlaceWater=false

# Craftable Sponges
#	Choose whether this plugin lets players craft
#	sponges or not. Useful for if you use another
#	plugin to handle crafting recipes.
craftableSponges=true

# Lava
#	Should lava be affected also? Lava will be treated
#	exactly like water as chosen in the other settings.
absorbLava=false

# Debug Messages
#	This tends to spam your console, so you'd be best
#	served leaving this off unless you know what
#	you're doing.
debug=false

# Fire
#	Should fire be affected too??? It'll get treated
#	just like the liquids.
absorbFire=false

# Reduce Overhead
#	I recommand you keep this off. In normal circumstances
#	the sponge database is saved on every sponge break
#	and place, thus keeping the plugin safe for server 
#	crashes. With this option turned on, the sponge database
#	will only be saved on plugin disable (clean exits).
reduceOverhead=false

# Affected Radius
#	Here you can choose how large the area the sponge affects
#	will be. It is based on the numbers of blocks away from
#	the sponge. For example, setting this to 2 will give you a
#	5x5x5 block area. It's recommended that you do not set
#	this value to high as the plugin must check every block
#	in the set radius.
spongeRadius=2
